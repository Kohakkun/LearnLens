LearnLens: Mind Awake, No Mistake!

The main focus of this project is to develop an AI-based "drowsiness" detection system called "LearnLens," which can be integrated into real-time learning during video conferences. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze images of students' faces captured through the camera, detecting changes in eye patterns and facial expressions that indicate signs of drowsiness or loss of focus. The AI will display the student's focus level status in real time during the video conference, so this system is expected to help improve productivity and create a more conducive environment for online learning.
